This act outlines many risk categories, applying more stringent restrictions and regulations to certain use cases coming under higher-risk categories, like facial recognition, and outrightly banning use cases like those that manipulate humans to circumvent their free will or engage in social scoring schemes by governments. The different risk categories, their measurement, and how and who performs conformity assessment will be key topics of discussion during the year. The European Parliament has been analyzing the act in many committees. In addition, the European Council comprising the heads of both government and state of all EU member states will take a stand on the issue. This council wields a lot of influence because of the people it involves even though it lacks official legislative power. In the United, while the AI regulation is yet to be introduced, the Federal Trade Commission has already warned firms about issues like algorithmic discrimination as well as how the current legislation can penalize those guilty of flouting the rules. Meredith Whittaker is a senior advisor on artificial intelligence at the FTC. In 2021, China put into effect major laws – The Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law. Enacted in November 2021, the former determines how user data may be utilized while the latter, which was passed in September 2021, forces firms to classify information depending on its relevance and economic value to Chinese national security. More legislation is expected to follow.</li>
              <li>Transformation in Robotics Begins With AI - AI in robotics is the integration of AI technology with robots enabling them to more efficiently perform repetitive tasks without human intervention.

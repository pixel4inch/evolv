IoT can help staffing managers in providing for better staffing and scheduling efficiencies, thereby improving workflows. For instance, IoT helps in collecting data related to location of staff, patient location, and the location of important medical equipment. The data can be used to ascertain the movement of equipment and staff, and would enable in predicting the need for the same in various departments. In this way, hospitals will be able to make proper resource allocation and on-demand scheduling. IoT is also useful in handling the critical issue of alert fatigue, which is responsible for a growing number of patient deaths or injuries. Alert fatigue happens when there are too many false alarms. With the help of IoT, healthcare facilities can link smart monitoring devices with patient rooms, records, nursing staff, pharmacies, and other critical information. The sensors embedded in these smart devices capture and collect data, which is then analyzed to ascertain whether a loud alarm should be triggered for critical, life-threatening events or a silent alarm should be triggered for harmless, non-critical events. IoT will therefore help in reducing false alarms, cuts down on work load, and improves timely action, thereby augmenting patient safety and care. Besides improving operational efficiencies, IoT in healthcare also supports physicians in making informed, more accurate and faster diagnosis; and in deciding personalized treatment agendas.</li>

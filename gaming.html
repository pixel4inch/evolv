          <h3 class="subheading">The Gaming Arena is Changing. Are We Ready?</h3>
          <div class="textless text-left">
            <p>The world gaming industry has over the decades witnessed sea changes in sync with technology changes. Video games have touched the lives of billions of people ever since the launch of the first ever graphics based video game in the early 1960s, so much so that today gaming is ingrained into the modern culture. From mere text adventures to graphically explicit immersive games, the video games industry has made significant progress and continues to do so. From the arcade boom to the rise of home computers and game consoles to the current disruptive mobile based gaming, the industry has seen meteoric rise in popularity over the past several decades. Business models have also continued to change and evolve. Digital games have revolutionized the way games are distributed and sold, and have played instrumental roles in opening up the concept of free-to-play models. With free-to-play games, consumers today spend greater time on games and this translates to greater probability of spending on in-game purchases. As a result business models are shifting from sales of single unit console or software to towards a recurring revenue model where active user base contributes to the revenue turnover potential. New generation games like “Fortnite” and “Call of Duty” are today designed around free-to-play with in-game purchase options which have massive potential for driving revenues for companies like Activision Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive. A recurring payment strategy has more ability to encourage higher average consumer spending than standalone game purchase that dominated the industry less than a decade ago. The incredible success of social games like FarmVille stands testimony to the power of in-game purchases and micro-transactions.</p>
            <p>But as video games migrate away from console-based experiences to more real-time, digital- and mobile-driven platforms, gamer behavior and the way gamers interact with their games are also rapidly shifting. To increase user engagement rates under such as scenario, companies are looking to develop highly engaging games and also looking to adopt innovative in-game monetization opportunities. The integration of additional downloadable content such as expansion packs, characters, tools, and new features present gaming companies with added avenues to generate revenues. The evolution of this business model has been strongly encouraged by improvements in Internet connectivity, especially mobile Internet services, penetration of cheap mobile data, advancements in gaming hardware which are enabling users to gain access to a wide range of high-quality games across varied platforms and devices; and development of online digital financial transactions. Growing prominence of video games as a form of modern artistic expression and entertainment and acceptance of video gaming as an educative and meaningful leisure activity was the major change in consumer perception triggered by the pandemic that helped and will continue to help expand the audience base for video games. The educational value offered by video games is resulting in the creation of a new trend called “Gamification of Education”, where games are used as valuable high-tech teaching tool to impart 21st century skills such as creative thinking, problem solving and collaboration.</p>
            <p>The gaming ecosystem comprises of diverse participants encompassing companies with game hardware and software capabilities like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo; independent developers and self-publishing companies like EA, Activision Blizzard, and Epic Games. Companies with no hardware capabilities rely on the gaming pipelines such as gaming consoles for distributing their content. Game developers, game publishers (distributors), hardware developers, software developers, and streaming service providers, in short, make up the gaming ecosystem. Technology developments will create a stronger ecosystem in the coming years. The gaming community is also growing stronger which is a vital prerequisite for growth of the industry. Interactions that emerge from the gameplay both inside and outside the game play key roles in building the gaming community.  “Meta-game” interactions include cheatsheets, hints, player community forums where games are discussed and strategies are analyzed and documented. These often times hold more value than the game itself as they draw in more new gamers into the scene. Game researchers can draw on player reflection, analysis, and collaboration, all contained within this ecosystem, to develop more engaging games.  </p>
            <p>The industry stands at the cusp of yet another significant development with the advent of web 3.0. Technology promises to open a new era in gaming, from in-game purchases to now allowing players to earn money while they play, a fundamental change in the industry is underway. Supported by web 3.0, players when they spend money to buy a virtual game asset can now own them and sell them to other players, both inside and outside the game. This is unlike web 2.0 where even after buying the asset, the gamer does not own it and cannot monetize it since the asset is tied to the game and not the player. Blockchain technology promises to change this and along with web 3.0 will now enable in-game asset ownership and each asset will have a finite supply with ownership residing with the gamer post sale. As these assets are finite in supply, the scarcity allows players to lucratively sell them to others. A key underlying concept also making this a reality is NFTs that enable digital asset scarcity and ownership similar to digital currency. With in-app purchases driving over 55% of gaming revenue, the ability to monetize gaming skills is a major development that will help games to evolve beyond being just a mere commodity. Games will become economies, and players and game developers will have real economic output.</p>

          <h3 class="subheading">Exciting New Technologies to Watch Out For</h3>
          <div class="textless text-left">
              <p>Each year brings exciting new trends, business and revenue models and business leaders need to be aware to be able to tap into opportunities in a timely manner. Few of the fast-paced cutting edge trends emerging with exceptional clarity include AR/VR, Blockchain, NFT, Cloud-Based Games, and the Metaverse.</p>

              <ul>

                <li>AR/VR - Defined as the integration of virtual data into the real world to enhance the physical and sensory perception of the world, Augmented Reality (AR) represents one of the most interactive and digitally versatile innovations of the 21st century. While virtual reality (VR) technology enables creation of an artificial world that a person can explore and experience interactively through sense of vision, audio, tactile or any other feedback, augmented reality takes it one step further by enabling interactive experience in a real world rather than an artificial environment. Already there are hundreds of gaming applications designed for use with Samsung Gear and PlayStation VR. VR applications market will especially be driven by action and adventure genre given the compelling graphics and visuals they bring to the background. A key factor fueling demand for AR/VR games is the immersive experience provided by the technology. The launch of virtual reality-enabled home consoles is also expected to help sustain growth prospects for video gaming consoles market despite the onslaught by online and mobile gaming segments. </li>
                <li>Cloud Gaming - Cloud gaming enables game developers and game service providers to provide engaging digital media experiences on any platform, anytime, anywhere and build strong consumer loyalty and also to scale their services globally without burdening their existing infrastructure. Gratifying digital media experiences have the potential to help build rewarding customer relationships and loyalty. Few of the benefits of cloud gaming include freedom from gaming consoles and the need to invest in expensive and complicated hardware and software; any-device gaming i.e. desktop PC, tablet, smartphone, laptop; ability to support multiscreen gaming for a super widescreen gaming experience and full field-of-vision; click-to-play simplicity; and anytime access to a wide library of game titles stored on the cloud server. Cloud gaming also make obsolete digital downloads where games need to be downloaded, and installed to be played. The gaming model also eliminates the need for frequent game patches. </li>
                <li>Blockchain - The technology is anticipated to result in novel games, asset classes, and application areas. Blockchain is offering novel opportunities for those that seek to design gaming apps that are decentralized. The use of blockchain in gaming apps is anticipated to be the main factor driving the world gaming market. Cryptocurrencies and NFTs are used to buy in-game assets, which can be used to obtain real-life money. Cryptocurrency such as Ethereum and Bitcoin facilitate quick and safe payments for different in-game purchases. Also, it enables players to obtain Crypto tokens or rewards during gaming. Blockchain works to offer freedom and decentralization and this enable gamers to actually exploit the capabilities of games. The technology facilitates in bringing together communities and is likely to offer a more immersive experience. In blockchain gaming, the transactions are similar to requiring an entrance fee from other players to gain access to the environment created by the user. The fee can be converted into actual currency via a cryptocurrency. Also, the other players playing the game can obtain cryptocurrency for finishing the challenges created by the user. In this, the players would own the game. Besides its role as a payment mechanism to enable game purchases, blockchain has potential role in the creation and management of in-game currency accounts. Players can be rewarded with gems, coins and other collectibles after winning certain rounds or challenges, with blockchain becoming the basis for managing the functioning of this process. </li>
                <li>Metaverse - The metaverse experience is as closely immersive as the real world and has immense opportunities in the video games industry. Metaverse is taking shape with immersive gaming worlds taking a lead on how users experience the virtual reality using their virtual identities and how they socially interact, tour, engage in pleasure activities and conduct business within the digital world using either real or cryptocurrency. Roblox, an online gaming company, flaunts immersive virtual reality landscapes, growing repertoire of user developed games and virtual spaces that have successfully hosted and monetized live concerts using independent digital currency. Roblox capitalized on the draw of metaverse and its own strength of user base by hosting exclusive product launches from luxury fashion brands, co-creation of games and enticing gamers to access these products in exchange for the digital currency. The company bought Guilded that engages in integrating online gaming platforms. Architecture software design firm Autodesk is exploring its 3D design capabilities to create virtual prototypes for AR and VR applications of metaverse.</li>
                <li>Artificial Intelligence - In video games, artificial intelligence is primarily used in ascertaining the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs) in the games. Traditionally, NPCs behave as per pre-programmed rules, and are therefore predictable for experienced gamers. AI could make these characters behave more intelligently by the use of Finite State Machine (FSM), which is an algorithm that was introduced in video gaming in the 1990s via games such as Half-Life, Dragon Quest IV, and Warcraft. An FSM predicts every possible situation that the AI program of the game could encounter and accordingly generates a suitable reaction for each possible occurrence. There are advanced FSMs that use machine learning to enable NPCs to adapt to the gaming behavior of players, thus making them more challenging and more unpredictable. AI in game development is mainly used for defining the manner in which the behavior of the computer opponent. AI game programming mainly makes use of techniques such as pathfinding and decision trees. Another way by which artificial intelligence is transforming video games is through enhancement of graphics quality. AI could be used by animators to analyze the way machines, animals, and human beings move in real life situations. By scanning and analyzing number of hours of real-life footage, game designers could develop characters with more realistic movements, displaying authentic facial expressions to deliver gaming experiences that are more emotionally immersive.</li>

          <h3 class="subheading">Decline in 2022 is Nothing to Worry About. Outlook for 2023 Remains Bright</h3>
          <div class="textless text-left">
              <p>Interesting after being one of the few industries to actually benefit from the pandemic and post robust growth, the video games market is currently snapping under the pressure of rising inflation, reduced consumer disposable incomes, supply chain disruptions, and chip shortages that are impacting production of gaming hardware such as consoles and delaying scheduled launches. Continuous delays in new game titles are also impacting consumer interest and willingness to engage in games in the year 2022. The worsening economic fundamentals and the dreaded fall in consumer confidence and sentiment is impacting spending on new video games and is resulting in shrinking revenues for the market for the year. This slump in video games sales in 2022 comes in stark contrast to the once hailed “recession-proof” sector. However, the outlook for 2023 is expected to improve since video games will continue to keep levelling up with graphics becoming more realistic and fantastical by the year and gameplay richer, smoother and storylines adroitly designed pull at consumer heartstrings. Also improving economic climate in the year 2023 will help put growth back on track. The market in the medium term will continue to benefit from rapid developments in hardware and software gaming platforms and revival of investments in the development of new game genre, ideas and titles. Few of the factors that will drive improved player engagement and thereby the increase in the number of active gamers worldwide will include launch of virtual reality headsets and smartglasses that lend visual realism to games; development of graphic-intensive games with more engaging and digitally immersive gameplays; rise of social games with viral connections for more continuous engagement; launch of games with no pre-defined ends, with ample in-game rewards and continuous offline evolution of game characters designed for addictive play style; “Always On” sensors in electronic wearables, the ensuing rise of video game enablement on wearables and design of micro-engagement models targeted at grabbing player attention for just few seconds for an extreme user engagement.</p>

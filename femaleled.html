                  <p class=" m-0">Women nowadays are now making active participation in all walks of society and the
                    global business market is no exception to this. Driven by increasing financial support, number of
                    female entrepreneurs is witnessing a significant increase in both developed and developing
                    economies. Several employees are of opinion that working in a women-led organizations enable them to
                    maintain an appropriate work-life balance. Comfortable workplace environment, equal pay, and job
                    satisfaction are some of the major reasons behind growing popularity of female-led companies. High
                    job satisfaction, along with ample carrier growth opportunities are propelling professionals to join
                    team of female entrepreneurs. In contrast to their male counterparts, companies led by women CEOs
                    are earning significantly higher profitability margins. One of the major reasons behind growing
                    success of female entrepreneurs is their strategy of providing equal opportunities for all
                    employees. This is assisting organizations in addressing requirement of workers from different
                    racial and ethnic backgrounds. Propelled by their abilities to increase revenues, several leading
                    global organizations are now appointing women in various leadership positions. Earlier, majority of
                    financial institution refrained from making investments in companies led by females. However, due to
                    constantly rising return on investment, several globally recognized firms are now investing in
                    women-run organizations. For instance, We-Fi is currently providing substantial funds for female
                    entrepreneurs owning small businesses. Additionally, Goldman Sachs, a leading global financial
                    services company is offering support for various women-led companies. Constantly rising funding
                    opportunities is enabling female entrepreneurs to introduce a wide range of high-end products as
                    well as services. Apart from earning substantial profits, women-led organizations are also offering
                    ample employment opportunities for young people. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Despite growing voices for women empowerment, number of female-owned small and medium
                    enterprises (SMEs) continue to remain at low levels. Widescale prevalence of gender-based
                    discriminatory practices within the society remain one of the reasons behind such a scenario. As a
                    result, women face a lot of challenges in obtaining loans from financial institutions for their
                    business ventures. Men continues to hold leadership position in highly profitable and faster growing
                    sectors such as computers, electronics, as well as transport. In contrast to this, women
                    participation in labor intensive and less-profitable sectors including retail, textile, and garment
                    is exhibiting a robust increase. This remains one of the major reasons behind constantly widening
                    income gap between men and women. As a result of widescale income disparity, the global economy is
                    incurring losses of $170 trillion. In order to overcome these challenges, various countries are
                    devising a wide range of innovative strategies. Under this initiative, they are simplifying process
                    associated with obtaining loans, grants, and funds from banks for female entrepreneurs. In addition,
                    several governments are undertaking procedures for creating efficient women business associations.
                    Apart from this, they are also giving a lot of impetus on developing innovative policies for
                    supporting women entrepreneurs. All these initiatives are expected to assist countries in
                    significantly increasing presence of women in high-growth business segments. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">In order to achieve success in todayâ€™s highly competitive global business environment,
                    it is important for entrepreneurs to constantly upgrade their skills. In contrast to their male
                    counterparts, there are relatively few globally recognized female business mentors and guides. As a
                    result, they face a lot of challenges in obtaining necessary guidance and advice required for
                    establishing a high-end global organization. Private clubs, golf courses, and shooting ranges are
                    primarily used for conducting business meetings and building social networks. However, majority of
                    women entrepreneurs are either not a member or else barred from entering these high-profile places.
                    As a result, they are required to undergo a strenuous process for creating their own business
                    networks. Nevertheless, advent of women specific networking clubs is offering a safe and comfortable
                    environment for conducting corporate meetings and events. Various female entrepreneurs are availing
                    services offered by social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook for connecting with their
                    fellow counterparts. Apart from this, constantly increasing women business mentors is also fostering
                    growth for female entrepreneurs. Despite growing participation of women in economic activities, they
                    are yet to acquire leadership roles in global organizations. </p>

                  <br />
                  <p class=" m-0">It is mandatory for companies to provide long maternity leaves for pregnant women,
                    which affects their overall productivity. As a result, they usually refrain from offering leadership
                    positions to female employees. In order to address this concern, several globally recognized firms
                    are giving a lot of impetus on creating a women-friendly workplace environment. The innovative
                    strategy is assisting females in creating an appropriate balance between their personal and
                    professional lives. Constantly rising number of female-led organizations is expected to contribute
                    Â£9.5bn as additional revenues in the UK economy. With an intention to improve employee efficiency,
                    various female-owned organizations are now adopting hybrid work modules. The novel mechanism is
                    playing an important role in significantly enhancing employee productivity as well as performance.
                    In order to curtail costs, several female entrepreneurs are now appointing freelancers for IT
                    support, marketing, as well as preparing pay rolls. The innovative strategy is assisting them in
                    curtailing unnecessary costs, thereby improving their overall profitability margins. On the other
                    hand, it is also offering ample opportunities for freelancers to significantly increase their
                    earnings. While women accounted for 38% of the global workforce, 3.5 million mothers lost their jobs
                    in the year 2020. With majority of firms adopting regressive employment practices, number of
                    unemployed females is witnessing a significant increase. To foster economic growth, several
                    countries are now appointing women in executive as well as leadership positions. Apart from this,
                    they are also offering ample financial incentives for female entrepreneurs. In a nutshell, despite
                    few impediments, the global market for women-owned organizations is expected to witness a robust
                    growth.</p>

                    of difficulties in accessing funds from financial institutions. As a result, male continues to
                    occupy leadership position in various leading global large-sized business enterprises. Owing to
                    insufficient funding, number of female-led SMEs and MSMEs is yet to witness a significant increase.
                    For instance, women currently own only 28% and 38% of overall global MSMEs and microenterprises,
                    respectively. Majority of financial institutions refrain from making venture capital investment in
                    female-led start-ups. As a result, number of women entrepreneurs continue to remain at a low level
                    in various European Union countries. In order to overcome this challenge, several financial
                    institutions are now giving a lot of impetus on appointing female fund managers. Additionally, with
                    an intention of propelling women entrepreneurship, they introduced dedicated venture capital funds
                    and financial instruments. Introduction of various advanced programs such as Centre for the
                    Development of Industrial Technology, Bpifrance, and Bpifrance are enabling women entrepreneurs to
                    easily obtain funds for their business ventures. In order to increase participation of females in
                    science, technology, engineering and mathematics segments, various European Union countries launched
                    skill development programs. This is playing an important role in significantly increasing number of
                    women scientists as well as researchers. Fueled by high growth prospects, various women
                    entrepreneurs are now establishing their own venture capital investment firms. All these positive
                    developments are expected to open new avenues of growth for female entrepreneurs in the European
                    Union.</p>

                  <p class=" m-0">While COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted global economic scenario, it opened new
                    avenues of growth for various small and medium sized organizations. Propelled by promising outlook,
                    approximately 5.4 million new organizations were established in the US during 2021. Out of these,
                    majority were owned by women from Black and African American communities. For instance, percentage
                    of business owned by Black and Hispanic women witness a significant increase of 515% and 450%,
                    respectively. Constantly increasing number of female-led organizations are offering ample job
                    opportunities for people. Apart from this, they are also allowing companies to earn over $385
                    billion as revenues annually. Growing participation of women in various economic sector would enable
                    the US government to create 4 million new jobs. Apart from this, the novel strategy is also expected
                    to the country to garner $1.2 trillion of additional revenue. Fueled by high growth prospect,
                    several females are now entering the highly prospective microbusinesses segment. At present, women
                    currently own 40% of all microbusinesses in the UK, which is significantly higher than 32% in the
                    year 2020. Similarly, share of black and Asian entrepreneurs in the UK also witness a considerable
                    increase to reach 6.6% as well as 11.9%, respectively. Constantly increasing contribution of women
                    in the global economy is propelling governments to undertake steps for removing gender-based
                    discrimination. In order to fulfil this requirement, various countries are now appointing females on
                    various legislative, managerial, and leadership positions. For instance, Togo and Belarus both has
                    highest number of women performing various technical and professional responsibilities. Due to
                    constantly improving global economic scenario, wages for women are exhibiting a marginal increase.

                    devise a wide range of novel strategies. Under this initiative, they are propelling companies
                    operating in the transportation, agriculture, and energy generation sectors to use sustainable
                    technologies. Driven by their abilities to curtail CO2 emission levels, demand for eco-friendly

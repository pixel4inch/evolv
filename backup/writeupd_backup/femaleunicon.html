                  <p class=" m-0">Recent years have seen female founded companies grow in numbers, with a higher percentage of them also breaking into the unicorn club. Many start-ups are being co-founded by women, and even funded by women entrepreneurs. Stax, a payments company based in Florida; Globalization Partners, a global employment platform based in Boston; and Insider, a customer engagement service based in Singapore, all have female founder CEOs as their heads. Rising to the top and listed as unicorns are female founded Papaya Global, a human resource and payroll platform based in New York; Market Kurly, a premium food delivery company based in Seoul; and LaunchDarkly, a software feature management platform based in Oakland. Then there are biotechnology companies such as Humacyte, Immunocore and Lyell Immunopharma who have women CEOs. While many of these women-led start-ups and unicorns are private, there has been an increase in numbers of those who went public. Conversely, despite not being valued as unicorn in private financing, many have been valued over US$1 billion as they made their debut in public markets. Examples include Bumble, a dating app; FIGS, an apparel company; a.k.a., an online fashion brand; and Clear, a biometric identity company. Though they are yet to take a larger share of the market pie, the trend is clear that women leaders are here to make heads turn with their innovative business ideas. </p>

                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Even as the number of female founded unicorns has increased over the previous decade, the journey for women entrepreneurs has been and continues to be challenging. They counter several hurdles when launching their companies, including attracting venture capital for investment. White women or women of color, they face similar challenges, which again could be owing to the fact that there are not many female role models to learn from. Without influencers, many dreaming big are simply unable to steer their way to the leadership position. On an optimistic note, some trailblazing female founders who have dared to defy the status quo could show others how they set their goals and achieved them without giving in to setbacks. Their success could serve as guidance for newbies who can learn to maneuver their business to the zenith of success. </p>
                  <br />

                  <p class=" m-0">Following are some of the top women leaders making waves in the business world: </p>
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emily Weiss of Glossier:</strong> Founded by Emily Weiss and valued at US$1.8 billion,
                      Glossier is a unicorn company with presence in the beauty industry. Emily Weiss could serve as a
                      great role model considering the way she established and grew her business. Beginning with
                      “intothegloss.com”, her beauty blog that she started writing in 2010, E. Weiss amassed a massive
                      following in four years, from where she headed to launch her own beauty company ‘Glossier’. After
                      being rejected by 11 venture capital firms, she finally secured $1 million in funding from
                      Forerunner Ventures that helped her launch her company with four products. Without aggressively
                      addressing each aspect of the beauty sector, E. Weiss worked towards developing a core product
                      offering. As she fine-tuned the core offering, she ventured into skincare, makeup, perfume and
                      merchandise to successful gain foothold in various categories. The most interesting element in the
                      success of Glossier is perhaps the blog that connects the company and its target audience. The
                      company truly makes beauty products for its community, allows them to test its minimum viable
                      product, and knows exactly what they want through the social channel. What makes the Glossier
                      brand unique is positing of user-generated content online, which imparts a more community-driven,
                      personal and authentic appeal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Melanie Perkins of Canva:</strong> Melanie Perkins holds all the secrets that aspiring
                      women leaders can follow to enter female-led unicorn club. Just as E. Weiss, M. Perkins treaded
                      her way with a humble beginning starting a yearbook design and publishing firm with Cliff Obrecht.
                      M. Perkins, along with C. Obrecht and Cameron Adams founded Canva in 2013 as a full-fledged design
                      platform for creating premium digital designs. The lady worked her way up to the unicorn status by
                      staying focused on finding solution for some real-world problems. She successfully created a
                      seamless user experience for all those facing difficulties in learning the graphic design process,
                      which helped her raise the valuation of her company to US$40 billion. As of 2021, Canva addresses
                      the needs of as many as 60 million monthly users across 190 countries. M. Perkins could be a role
                      model for aspiring entrepreneurs to remain resilient in the face of adversities, being rejected
                      more than 100 times for funding; refining her approach and communication skills to better present
                      the way in which Canva could innovate the graphic design sector, and solve truly major
                      world-problems. Indeed, the founders are committed direct Canva’s revenues to solve some biggest
                      world problems such as poverty. The founders also offer Canva’s premium services for free to
                      non-profit organizations and teachers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tessa Wijaya of Xendit:</strong> Tessa Wijaya’s fintech company Xendit became a unicorn
                      in September 2021. Just as M. Perkins, T. Wijaya worked towards resolving a real-world problem.
                      Her journey began when she successfully landed the job of an analyst in a private equity firm all
                      owing her strong mentality though she had no experience. With time, T. Wijaya gain prominence in
                      the financial industry in the Southeast Asia, and in 2015, she founded Xendit with the intention
                      of bringing ride-hailing services and e-commerce closer in the region. By 2015, Xendit had emerged
                      as one of the leading payment platforms in Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia and
                      Philippines. Aspiring women leaders can take heed from T. Wijaya’s leadership traits that made her
                      company become a unicorn. The female leader spent years studying finance after her workhours, seek
                      opportunities that remain unnoticed by others, and act quickly to change the dynamics of the
                      market. T. Wijaya can be viewed as a mentor for women in the field of engineering, technology,
                      mathematics and science.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lucy Liu of Airwallex:</strong> Lucy Liu is the co-founder of fintech payment platform,
                      Airwallex, a US$4 billion unicorn, which exceed US$100 million in annual revenues in 2021.
                      Mirroring other female founders, L. Liu solved a real-world problem when she co-founded Airwallex
                      in 2016 along with Max Li and Jack Zhang, contributing through her expertise in finance. Airwallex
                      helps customers overcome the issue of dealing with unreasonable bank fees when they import goods
                      from overseas markets. L. Liu serves as an example for women desiring to found their own
                      companies, as she resonates with understanding one’s strengths, working as a team and
                      acknowledging the contribution of all team members in leading the company to success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sarah Leary of Nextdoor:</strong> Sarah Leary is a co-founder of Nextdoor, valued at
                      US$4.3 billion. Nextdoor is an app designed to connect people in the neighborhood. Just as E.
                      Weiss, S. Leary built her consumer-centric business by nurturing a powerful community of users.
                      The idea to start Nextdoor germinated when S. Leary and her business partner Nirav Tolia,
                      recognized the absence of a platform where people could connect with their neighbors. They made
                      physical visits to neighborhoods to understand the type of solution they need to develop.
                      Nextdoor, as of 2021, connects as many as 10 million users across 116,000 neighborhoods throughout
                      the neighborhood. S. Leary is a fine role model for many a women entrepreneurs or aspiring women
                      who can learn the importance of testing out-of-the-box, yet simple ideas that could really nurture
                      a unicorn. Testing is important to understand what can or cannot work without spending too much
                      money. The female founder also believes in investing in other entrepreneurs at every given
                      opportunity, which made her handover her position of Vice President of Global Marketing and
                      Operations to another potential aspirant. S. Leary is also a venture partner in Unusual Ventures
                      where she offers the same opportunities to entrepreneurs that she received when securing funds for
                      her businesses.</li>

                    Startups Thrive, But Where are Female Founders!</button>

                <div class="card-body p-5 textless">
                  <p class=" m-0">India has emerged as a global hotbed of startups, next only to the US and the UK. As
                    many as 100 Indian startups have already joined the unicorn club. But something that draws attention
                    is the lack of women representation in majority as founders of these startups. A mere 15% of Indian
                    unicorns can boast of having at least one women founder. Many women entrepreneurs face rejection
                    when seeking venture capital. Why? One of the biggest drawbacks is the Indian society, generally
                    called the pipeline issue, where women are subjected to limitations since early childhood. There are
                    societal restrictions over her movement out of home and mingling with people. Then there is lack
                    financial independence in many societies. Despite growing literary rates and more women graduating
                    in India, they are expected to seek employment that does not disturb family life. This type of
                    environment is less conducive for women to thrive as entrepreneurs, as they are required to network
                    with people to find co-founders, venture capital, discuss plans and seek mentorship and advice.
                    Indian female founders are subjected to many biases and prejudices when they seek venture capital
                    for their business, and work against the very absence of professional networks much need for
                    connecting with others. Addressing the issues at the ecosystem level could produce positive
                    outcomes.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p class="m-0">Indian corporate landscape just does not need female founders, but also female
                    investors. An ecosystem with more women participation can dramatically reduce biases and biased
                    questions that female entrepreneurs face in present times. At the other end, the entire business
                    community needs to be sensitized to make everyone realize the biases do exist and they need to be
                    addressed by adopting a more objective screening process. Presently, very few Indian unicorn
                    companies have at least one female founder, including Acko Insurance, BYJU’S, Hasura, Lead School,
                    Livspace, Mamaearth, Mobikwik, Nykaa, OfBusiness, Pristyn Care, Rivigo, The Good Glamm Group and
                    Zenoti. The 100th Indian unicorn, Open has two women founders Deena Jacob and Mabel Chacko of Open.
                    Many of the female founder unicorns operate in the e-commerce industry. Nykaa’s founder Falguni
                    Nayar, became the wealthiest Indian women entrepreneur when her beauty ecommerce platform went
                    public in 2022. She also represents the first Indian women to head a publicly listed startup, and
                    since is being widely seen as an inspiration and role model for aspiring women entrepreneurs in
                    India.</p>
                  <p class="m-0">Albeit slow, the business milieu is changing for Indian female founders. Women
                    participation at entrepreneurship level is growing since over a decade, and has accelerated in the
                    previous couple of years. Backed by studies that indicate gender diversity to enhance productivity
                    and contribute to growth of companies, Indian women entrepreneurs can drive the economic growth
                    further. The role of the Government of India cannot be undermined, as it has undertaken various
                    initiatives to encourage women entrepreneurship. Niti Aayog’s Women Entrepreneurship Platform, Stree
                    Shakti Scheme, Mahila Udyam Nidhi Scheme and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana are all government
                    sponsored schemes formed to support female business leaders. While many negatives come to fore when
                    the Indian society and mindset is taken into view to be largely responsible for lesser women
                    entrepreneurs in the country, something that often is overlooked is the strong family support fabric
                    that Indian homes provide to an aspiring woman.</p>
                  <p class="m-0">Already, there are few female founders when taken as a whole= and their proportion
                    narrows down further when it comes to technology. Key reasons could be less of hands-on experience
                    necessary for coding, and lesser self-confidence due to perception of technology being tougher to
                    understand. The industry demands longer working hours, frequent travelling and most importantly
                    networking. Self-doubt causes more damage than external factors to brilliant female minds. With hard
                    work and by building self-confidence and nurturing ambition, women can deliver as technology leaders
                    as well.</p>
                  <p class="m-0">Increased women participation in technology events could raise more female technology
                    leaders. Successful women founders can leverage the various platforms to help other women
                    entrepreneurs attain success that could create more female leaders and founders in the tech space.
                    They can also leverage programs initiated by corporates or governments such as the Indian
                    government. A case in point is the Women Entrepreneurship Platform introduced by the Government of
                    India under NITI Aayog to promote existing and aspiring women entrepreneurs in the country. Then,
                    there are a few Angels/ funds who are consciously working to provide equal opportunities to women to
                    found companies.</p>
